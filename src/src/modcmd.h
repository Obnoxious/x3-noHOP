/* Modularized commands work like this:
 *
 * Modules define commands.  Services contain "bindings" of those
 * commands to names.
 *
 * The module-defined commands (modcmd structs) contain the parameters
 * fixed by code; for example, assuming a channel was provided, or
 * that the user has ChanServ access to that channel.
 *
 * Service command bindings (svccmd structs) define additional access
 * controls (and a count of how many times the command has been used)
 * as well as a link to the modcmd providing the function.
 *
 * Aliased commands are special svccmds that have alias expansion
 * information in an "extra" pointer.  In the future, this may be
 * moved into the svccmd struct if there are no other commands that
 * need "extra" data.
 *
 * The user must meet all the requirements (in flags, access levels,
 * etc.) before the command is executed.  As an exception, for the
 * "staff" permission checks (oper/network helper/support helper), any
 * one is sufficient to permit the command usage.
